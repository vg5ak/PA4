I imported the PA3Start into PA2. So there are two folders inside PA2, PA2Start and PA3Start.
In PA3Start I have java_cup, meggy, mjsimPictures, src, TestCases, and TestCasesMeggy. The TestCases and TestCasesMeggy do not actually house the
test cases. They were just in the Folder when I merged PA3Start. In the src folder I added the toneStart, the types, the call and new exps, and call statement into the cup. I implemented all the methods in CheckTypes, AVRcodeGen, and BuildSymTable, and while all of the test cases do not run, I can do tones, less than, user defined methods, and method calls. It is when multiple ones are implemented that it starts breaking, though I think that is to do with how I set my registers or allocate memory.


The PA3Start holds everything:
The src folder holds the mjparser, the AVRgenVisitor, BuildSymTable, CheckTypes
The symtable package holds: ClassSTE, makeScope, MethodSTE, Scope, STE, SymTable, Type, and VarSTE
